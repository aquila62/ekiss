The visual and amusement tests, included here, do not occur
in dieharder or TestU01.  Dieharder and TestU01 are statistical
test suites.  To test ekiss with dieharder or TestU01, feed
the output from ekissraw into those test suites.

Poisson distribution chi square test.
There are two parameters, lambda and size of population.

./poischi lambda size

./poischi 6 100000

The output from poischi is the chi square, with
number of degrees of freedom based on lambda.

------------------------------------------------------

The Anderson-Darling test for a normal distribution is
not included in this repository, because it requires a
statistical package, like R and the nortest library.
In my own testing, ekissnorm has passed the Anderson-
Darling test in the R package.  Input to the test was
a Gaussian distribution created by the Box-Muller transform.
ekissnorm.c produces numbers in the normal distribution.

Usage:
./ekissnorm mean stdev size

Example:
./ekissnorm 15.0 2.0 5000

The R package requires an upper limit of 5000 numbers
as input a test.

------------------------------------------------------

Test ekissint() by running ekisspat.
This test requires the new curses package.

sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev

./ekisspat

The output from ekisspat is a random pattern of ASCII characters
on a curses screen.  To quit press 'q'.

------------------------------------------------------

Test ekisspwr() by running tstdots.
This test requires X Windows.

sudo apt-get install libx11-dev

./tstdots

The output from tstdots is a random bitmap pattern of pixels 
on an X Windows screen, 512x512.  To quit press 'q'.

------------------------------------------------------

Random Walk Test:  ranwlk
This test requires X Windows.  See sudo apt-get above.

./tstwlk.sh

The output from tstwlksh is a random walk relative to a midpoint
line on an X Windows screen.  To quit press any key.

------------------------------------------------------

Captcha generator with random background and partially
random text colors.

Requires the Netpbm package.

sudo apt-get netpbm

Usage:

echo "text" | captcha | pnmtopng >mycaptcha.png

Uses font.txt 12x24 font file.

------------------------------------------------------

Random Powerball Simulation:  pwrball
pwrball is a random lottery game based on real odds
and real pay-outs.  The jackpot is $1 Billion.
This test requires new curses.  See apt-get above.

./pwrball

The output from pwrball shows money spent and money
received for each prize level.  To quit press 'q'.
The grand totals are in millions of dollars.
The lesser prizes are in thousands of dollars.

------------------------------------------------------

Dieharder Test:  tstdie.sh
Dieharder has to be installed first.

sudo apt-get install libdieharder-dev
sudo apt-get install dieharder

tstdie.sh illustrates how a raw stream of random data is piped
into a down stream test suite.

./tstdie.sh

The output from tstdie.sh is a statistical report.
This is a long running test.  To interrupt press CTRL-C.
The first test takes half minute to print a report.

------------------------------------------------------

TestU01 is more difficult to run with the ekiss generator.
You have to download the TestU01 package and then compile it.
Then you have to write and compile a test program in the
examples directory of TestU01.  The short guide for TestU01
gives you examples of how to set up a test.  In particular,
you need to use ufile to read input from ekissraw in your test.
After you get over the learning curve, you will be rewarded
with some strong and varied tests.
